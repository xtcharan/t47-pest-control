      appearance: "Norway rats have blunt snouts, small ears, and thick bodies reaching 7-10 inches in length with 6-8 inch tails. They're brown or gray in color with coarse fur.",
      lifestyle: "Excellent burrowers that typically nest at ground level or below. They're strong swimmers and prefer to live near water sources in sewers, basements, and ground floors.",
      habits: "Known for their cautious behavior and preference for protein-rich foods. They're nocturnal and can produce up to 7 litters per year with 8-12 pups each."

      appearance: "Sleeker bodies than Norway rats with pointed snouts and larger ears. Their tails are longer than their bodies, and they're typically black or dark brown.",
      lifestyle: "Excellent climbers that prefer elevated nesting areas like attics, trees, and upper building levels. They're more common in coastal and warmer regions.",

      lifestyle: "Curious by nature and excellent climbers that can squeeze through openings as small as a pencil (Â¼ inch). They prefer warm, hidden areas near food sources.",

      appearance: "Distinctively bi-colored tails (dark on top, light underneath) with larger eyes and ears compared to house mice. Bodies typically 3-4 inches long.",
      lifestyle: "Prefer outdoor habitats but often enter homes during colder months. They're excellent climbers and jumpers, capable of accessing elevated areas.",

      lifestyle: "Known for collecting or 'trading' objects, often leaving a new item in place of something they've taken. They build large, complex nests called middens.",
      habits: "These nests can be used for generations and contain food caches, debris, and collected items. They primarily feed on plants, fruits, and seeds."

      appearance: "Young rats can be mistaken for mice due to their smaller size, but they have proportionally smaller ears and feet compared to their body size than mice do.",
      lifestyle: "Grow rapidly, reaching sexual maturity in just 5-6 weeks. They follow similar patterns to adult rats but are more vulnerable to control measures.",
      habits: "Early identification is crucial for effective control, as a single pair of rats can produce up to 2,000 descendants in a year if left unchecked."
