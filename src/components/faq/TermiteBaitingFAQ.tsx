      question: "How much does a termite baiting system cost in Australia?",
      answer: "Many homeowners want to know the average price of termite baiting systems in Melbourne and other cities. Costs usually depend on property size, number of stations required, and ongoing monitoring. Generally, baiting systems range from $1,200-$3,500 for installation, with annual monitoring fees of $400-$900. While this may seem like a significant investment, it's minimal compared to the potential cost of termite damage, which can reach tens of thousands of dollars."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take for termite baiting systems to eliminate colonies?",
      answer: "This is one of the most common questions people search for in Australia. Termite baiting systems typically eliminate colonies within 6-12 weeks once termites begin feeding on the bait. The timeline depends on colony size, feeding activity, and environmental conditions. The slow-acting nature ensures complete colony elimination including the queen."
    },
    {
      question: "Are termite baiting systems better than chemical barriers?",
      answer: "Australians frequently ask about the comparison between baiting systems and chemical treatments. Both methods have advantages: baiting systems eliminate entire colonies and provide ongoing monitoring, while chemical barriers offer immediate protection. Many experts recommend baiting systems for environmentally sensitive areas and long-term colony management."
    },
    {
      question: "How often do termite bait stations need to be checked?",
      answer: "A big concern for property owners is maintenance requirements for baiting systems. Professional bait stations should be inspected every 8-12 weeks to monitor for termite activity and replace baits as needed. Regular monitoring ensures optimal system performance and early detection of any new termite activity around your property."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I install termite bait stations myself, or do I need a professional?",
      answer: "Many Australians search whether DIY baiting systems are effective or if professional installation is necessary. The truth is, professional systems are far more effective because technicians understand termite behavior, optimal placement strategies, and proper bait management. Professional installation ensures strategic placement, regular monitoring, and guaranteed colony elimination that DIY alternatives cannot match."
