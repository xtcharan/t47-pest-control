      question: "How much does a termite monitoring system cost in Australia?",
      answer: "Many homeowners want to know the average price of installing termite monitors in Melbourne and other cities. Costs usually depend on property size, number of stations required, and ongoing servicing. Generally, installation costs range from $800-$2,500, with annual monitoring fees of $300-$800. While this may seem like a significant investment, it's minimal compared to the potential cost of termite damage, which can reach tens of thousands of dollars."
    },
    {
      question: "Are termite monitoring systems better than chemical barriers?",
      answer: "This is one of the most common comparisons people search for in Australia. Both systems have their pros and cons, and many homeowners want to know which provides the best long-term protection. Monitoring systems offer early detection and targeted treatment, while chemical barriers provide immediate protection. Many experts recommend a combination approach for maximum protection, especially in high-risk areas."
    },
    {
      question: "How often should termite monitoring stations be checked?",
      answer: "Australians frequently ask about maintenance schedules. The standard servicing interval is every 10â€“12 weeks, ensuring any termite activity is detected early. Regular inspections are crucial because termites can establish colonies quickly, and early detection dramatically reduces potential damage and treatment costs."
    },
    {
      question: "Do termite monitoring systems really eliminate termite colonies?",
      answer: "A big concern for property owners is whether monitors just detect termites or if they actually kill the colony. The answer is that when bait is added, the system can wipe out the entire nest. The monitoring stations detect termite activity, and once confirmed, highly effective baits are introduced that termites carry back to the colony, eliminating the entire population including the queen."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I install termite monitoring stations myself, or do I need a professional?",
      answer: "Many Australians search whether DIY termite monitors are effective or if professional installation is necessary. The truth is, professional systems are more reliable because technicians know where to place and how to manage them for maximum effectiveness. Professional installation ensures proper placement, regular monitoring, and immediate response when activity is detected, providing far superior protection than DIY alternatives."
